No More

Eddie Vedder, Ben Harper

I speak for a man
Who gave for this land
Took a bullet in the back
For his pay
Spilled his blood
In the dirt and the dust
He's back to say
That what he has seen
Is hard to believe
And it does no good
To just pray
He asks of us to stand
And we must end this war today
With his mind
He's saying, "No more!"
With his heart
He's saying, "No more!"
With his life
He's saying, "No more war!"
With his eyes
He's saying, "No more!"
With his body
He's saying, "No more!"
With his voice
He's saying, "No more war!"
Well nothing's too good
For a veteran
Yeah, this is what they say
So nothing is what they will get
In this new American way
The lies we were told
To get us to go
War criminal
Let us be straight
Let's get to the point
Where our voices are heard
Behind the White House gates
With our minds
We're saying, "No more!"
With our hearts
We're saying, "No more!"
With our lives
We're saying, "No more war!"
With our eyes
We're saying, "No more!"
With our bodies
We're saying, "No more!"
With our voices
We're saying, "No more war!"
No more innocents dying
No more terrorizing
No more eulogizing
No more evangelizing
No more presidents lying
No more war
With our minds
We're saying, "No more!"
With our hearts
We're saying, "No more!"
With our lives
We're saying, "No more war!"
