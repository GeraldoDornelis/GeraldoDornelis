No More

Eddie Vedder, Ben Harper<p>

I speak for a man<p>
Who gave for this land<p>
Took a bullet in the back<p>
For his pay<p>
Spilled his blood<p>
In the dirt and the dust<p>
He's back to say<p>
That what he has seen<p>
Is hard to believe<p>
And it does no good<p>
To just pray<p>
He asks of us to stand<p>
And we must end this war today<p>
With his mind<p>
He's saying, "No more!"<p>
With his heart<p>
He's saying, "No more!"<p>
With his life<p>
He's saying, "No more war!"<p>
With his eyes<p>
He's saying, "No more!"<p>
With his body<p>
He's saying, "No more!"<p>
With his voice<p>
He's saying, "No more war!"<p>
Well nothing's too good<p>
For a veteran<p>
Yeah, this is what they say<p>
So nothing is what they will get<p>
In this new American way<p>
The lies we were told<p>
To get us to go<p>
War criminal<p>
Let us be straight<p>
Let's get to the point<p>
Where our voices are heard<p>
Behind the White House gates<p>
With our minds<p>
We're saying, "No more!"<p>
With our hearts<p>
We're saying, "No more!"<p>
With our lives<p>
We're saying, "No more war!"<p>
With our eyes<p>
We're saying, "No more!"<p>
With our bodies<p>
We're saying, "No more!"<p>
With our voices<p>
We're saying, "No more war!"<p>
No more innocents dying<p>
No more terrorizing
No more eulogizing<p>
No more evangelizing<p>
No more presidents lying<p>
No more war<p>
With our minds<p>
We're saying, "No more!"<p>
With our hearts<p>
We're saying, "No more!"<p>
With our lives<p>
We're saying, "No more war!"<p>
